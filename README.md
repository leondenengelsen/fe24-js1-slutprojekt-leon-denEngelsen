Questions answered:

- What I like the most?

I like setting everything up in HTML and planning out the main structure of the application.
At the same time this is my biggest weaknesess cause I tend to just start because I get a little stressed when a task seems  big and so I just want to get it out of the way. Because of this I often end up in a situation where I haven't thought things through well enough and have to restructure things like containers within containes and class names. an exemple is that I didn't know how to create a form where 1 input field functions for both movies and actors searches. I'f I did some research before starting building the site, I may not have ended up having to create two separate forms. One for actors and one for films.

With this I've answered the question about what I would have done differently next time. Better planning!

- the most challenging?
For some reason I had the most delay with figuring out how to make pages visable and invisable when moving trhough the website. I've ended up creating .hidden classes for all containers and adding and removing them depending on where the user wants to go.

It also took me a lot of time to realize that the anime info in .css is hidden by default (opacity 0) and will only be visable after anime is function is called in the JS file. 

- would do differently?
as mentioned above, better planning.. Also taking smaller chunks at the time and take brakes after every little progress. This way I'll probably keep more motivated and less frustrated.
