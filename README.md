Questions answered:

- What I like the most?

I like setting everything up in HTML and planning out the main structure of an application.
At the same time this is my biggest weaknesess cause I tend to just start because I get a little stressed when a task seems  big and so I just want to get it out of the way. Because of this I often end up in a situation where I haven't thought things through well enough and have to restructure things like containers within containes and class names. an exemple is that I didn't know how to create a form where 1 input field functions for both movies and actors searches. I'f I did some research before starting building the site, I may not have ended up having to create two separate forms. One for actors and one for films.

With this I've answered the question about what I would have done differently next time. Better planning!

- the most challenging?
For some reason I had the most delay with figuring out how to make pages visable and invisable when moving trhough the website. I've ended up creating .hidden classes for all containers and adding and removing them depending on where the user wants to go.
Having Anime implemented made it even more complecated since I overloked the fact that Opacity was set to 0 by default. 

Another thing I'm struggling with, or not really struggling by trying to find the sweet spot, is ChatGPT. How much? How often? How much Code? Do I still learn how to write code? Why write if GPT can do it? 
My solution: As long as It spits out stuff I understand or I can make it write something that I'd otherwise would have written manually, or else, if I can learn from it, I'm fine with it. But how do we deal with the fact that we'll maybe not have the same skillset to write code manually as a programmer that started 20 years ago?

- would do differently?
as mentioned above, better planning.. Also taking smaller chunks at the time and take brakes after every little progress. This way I'll probably keep more motivated and less frustrated.
